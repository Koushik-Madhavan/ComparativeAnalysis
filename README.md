# Predicting Diabetes with Machine Learning: A Comparative Analysis
 
Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

Introduction

This project aims to predict diabetes using machine learning techniques. By processing medical data, performing exploratory analysis, and applying various classification algorithms, we evaluate which model provides the most accurate predictions.

Project Steps

1. Data Processing

Load and clean the dataset

Handle missing or inconsistent values

Normalize features if necessary

Split the dataset into training and testing sets
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("diabetes.csv")

# Handle missing values (if any)
df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)

# Split the dataset
X = df.drop(columns=['Outcome'])
y = df['Outcome']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understand the dataset through visualizations

Identify patterns and correlations

Handle outliers and skewed distributions

Feature selection for model optimization

3. Machine Learning Models Implemented

Several classification models are trained and tested:

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Random Forest Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

XGBoost Classifier

4. Model Evaluation

To assess the effectiveness of each model, we use:

Accuracy score

Precision, recall, and F1-score

Confusion matrix analysis

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Algorithms)

XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)

Running the Project

1.Install required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost

2.Execute the script:
python diabetes_prediction.py

3.Observe model accuracy and performance metrics.

Results and Insights

Different models are tested to find the most accurate predictor.

Accuracy and other evaluation metrics are used for comparison.

The best-performing model can be further refined for real-world applications.

Future Scope

Integrating deep learning models for better performance

Deploying the model as a web or mobile application

Enhancing dataset features for improved accuracy
